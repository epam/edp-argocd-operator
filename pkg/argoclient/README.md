# argoclient

argoclient is http client for communication with argocd API.

## Description

`argoclient` is an HTTP client generated by [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) for communication with ArgoCD API.

Folders client, models are autogenerated from argocd openAPI specification file `swagger.yaml` (taken
from: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/assets/swagger.json)

Tool for autogeneration: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger

Command:

```shell
swagger generate client -f swagger.yaml --with-flatten=remove-unused
```

The following custom changes were made in `swagger.yaml` to fix API errors:

- Replaced invalid type format

before

```yaml
- type: string
  format: int64
```

after

```yaml
- type: integer
  format: int64
 ```

- type `v1Time` converted to type `string` instead of `object`
